## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Download Only Trusted Content**
   - Only download your own content or content you have permission to download
   - Verify URLs before downloading
   - Be cautious with shortened URLs

2. **Keep Software Updated**
   - Always use the latest version of Hikari TikTok Downloader
   - Keep Python and dependencies updated
   - Regularly update yt-dlp engine

3. **Safe Download Practices**
   - Choose a secure download location
   - Scan downloaded files if suspicious
   - Don't download to system directories

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - All URLs are validated before processing
   - File names are sanitized to prevent path traversal
   - User inputs are properly escaped

2. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS connections when possible
   - Proper error handling for network failures
   - No sensitive data in logs

3. **File System Security**
   - Safe file writing practices
   - Proper permissions on created files
   - No execution of downloaded content

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **URL Validation**: While we validate TikTok URLs, malicious redirects could potentially be an issue
2. **File Names**: Downloaded files use names from TikTok metadata, which could contain special characters
3. **Network Requests**: The application makes network requests to TikTok servers

### Mitigations in Place

1. **URL Sanitization**: URLs are validated against known TikTok patterns
2. **File Name Cleaning**: Special characters are removed from file names
3. **Error Handling**: Network errors are caught and handled gracefully
4. **No Code Execution**: Downloaded content is never executed

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

1. **Acknowledge** your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigate** the issue thoroughly
3. **Provide updates** on our progress
4. **Credit you** in our security advisories (if desired)
5. **Release fixes** as soon as safely possible

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
- Announced in release notes
- Highlighted in the README
- Distributed through normal update channels
